# Alpine

[![](https://badge.imagelayers.io/hence/base:latest.svg)](https://imagelayers.io/?images=hence/base:latest 'Get your own badge on imagelayers.io')

This is our minimal customized Alpine Linux base image based on
[alpine:edge](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/alpine/). Optionally you can
enable the ```logstash-forwarder```, to get it running you need to use ```s6```
and remove ```/etc/s6/forwarder/down```. If you start ```s6``` you will always
have running a cron daemon and logrotate as well, to rotate your logs you can
create a config file at ```/etc/logrotate.docker.d```

docker run -ti --name alpine webhippie/alpine:latest bash
